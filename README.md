This was an individual project in Computer Graphics class.

solvable puzzle with n rows and columns and one cell empty which is used to
move other cells arround. 

New Game button starts new game.
Resize button resizes to the given number of rows and columns.
Pause button pauses the timer until a new move is made.
Highscore button provides highscores for the given rows and columns puzzle.
